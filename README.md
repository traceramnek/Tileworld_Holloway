# Tileworld_Holloway

This is a modified game of Tileworld with a semi-intelligent AI. The Goal of this game is for the Agent( Blue Circle ) to roam around the map and push the Blocks( Purple Squares ) into the Holes( Black Squares ). Theere are also Obstacles( Gray Squares ) that the Agent cannot move.

The Agent can only puch 1 Block at a time and no more than that. The Agent moves 1 space to the North, South, East or West with each turn.
